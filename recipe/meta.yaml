    # XXX(tom): emsdk? no, use `jupyterlab` tooling to build extension from npm source (which will DL wasm blob)
    - xsimd # XXX(tom): Andrew says we shouldn't need this b/c we disable SIMD in arrow build
    - lz4 # XXX(tom): likewise, this should be built from source downloaded by psp repo script. and yet the build fails without it
    # Seems relevant, from the build spew:
    # By not providing "Findlz4.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
    # asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "lz4", but
    # CMake did not find one.
