    # git is required to build perspective, in order to clone its cmake
    # external projects. On windows, though, having git in the build
    # requirements causes conda-build to hang when cloning perspective's git
    # source, seems to be a conda-build bug.
    # Fortuantely the CI pipeline still passes on Windows without the dep.  For
    # local Windows builds, install git in the base system.

    # Shouldn't need this b/c perspective disables ARROW_SIMD_LEVEL and
    # ARROW_RUNTIME_SIMD_LEVEL in arrow build.  Funny thing is: without this
    # package, the build fails -- can't find Findxsimd.cmake.  But if you
    # immediately try rebuilding, it will then succeed, without xsimd on the
    # system.  Bewitching cmake cache behavior?
